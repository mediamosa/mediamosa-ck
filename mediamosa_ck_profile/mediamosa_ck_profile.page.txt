You have completed the installation of the MediaMosa Construction Kit. 

But before you proceed, setup the cron job for this website first. You can read how to configure your cron on page http://drupal.org/cron/.

We recommend that you check the MediaMosa Construction Kit settings on !url_mmck_settings.

During the setup you had the option to setup the MediaMosa Connector. If you have skipped it during setup, you can set it up on !url_mediamosa_connector.

Once MediaMosa Connector is setup, you can either wait until all mediafiles are synchronized to Drupal Media, or visit the MediaMosa Construction Kit settings page and use start synchronizing batch. 

To integrate MediaMosa videos in your HTML editor, we have setup wysiwyg module with default settings. You can review these settings on !url_wysiwyg.
